# BC_Focus_Code

This is a basic script for determining the focus.

This can be calculated using two methods;

## Method 1:
\t Input the focus that you are using and the FWHM (either of the whole image, or of a reasonably bright, but not over-saturated star) into a CSV in a format similar to focusBS.csv. It is recommended to get at least 7 data points (5 at the minimum).
\t Run main.csv.py

## Method 2:
\t Input the focus that you are using and the FWHM (either of the whole image, or of a reasonably bright, but not over-saturated star) into the arrays manually. It is recommended to get at least 7 data points (5 at the minimum).
